### About Me

Hi! I'm [Divyansh Prakash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyansh-prakash-0385bb93/), a 2014 BE (I&CT) graduate from MIT, Manipal.

I've been working in the software industry for the last few years, and have had the good fortune of using various (cutting edge) technologies in the process. I've worked on a broad range of software applications (professional/hobby), such as:
* distributed systems ([Koko Networks](http://kokonetworks.com/), [Helpshift](https://www.helpshift.com/))
* big data @ [Helpshift](https://www.helpshift.com/)
* games ([Kilvish Engine](http://divs1210.github.io/kilvish/), [Snake Demo](http://divs1210.github.io/snake-machine/))
* compilers, etc. ([CljOS](https://github.com/divs1210/cljos), [Imapala](https://github.com/divs1210/Impala), [OOJASIC](http://justaddhotwater.webs.com/oojasic.htm))

I am also fond of teaching, and have taught or otherwise helped people learn to code / get into the software industry - including several batchmates and juniors from Manipal.
