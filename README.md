## Programming Workshops

* **OOP with Java**

Java is a popular programming language that has permeated the industry and is used almost everywhere - from web servers to phones and appliances. Java developers are always in demand - plus it's sure to be in your syllabus if you are in CS or a related field.

* **FP with Clojure**

[Clojure](http://clojure.org) is a functional language that was ranked as the [top paying technology](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-top-paying-technologies-by-region) according to a survey by StackOverflow.com. It is a member of the [Lisp family of languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) and hence shares its academic value. Learning Lisp is said to be a [mind-expanding experience](http://www.paulgraham.com/quotes.html).

### About Me

Hi! I'm [Divyansh Prakash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyansh-prakash-0385bb93/), a 2014 BE (I&CT) graduate from MIT, Manipal.

I've been working in the software industry for the last few years, and have had the good fortune of using various (cutting edge) technologies in the process. I've worked on a broad range of software applications (professional/hobby), such as:
* distributed systems ([Koko Networks](http://kokonetworks.com/), [Helpshift](https://www.helpshift.com/))
* big data ([Helpshift](https://www.helpshift.com/))
* games ([Kilvish Engine](http://divs1210.github.io/kilvish/))
* compilers, etc. ([CljOS](https://github.com/divs1210/cljos), [Imapala](https://github.com/divs1210/Impala), [OOJASIC](http://justaddhotwater.webs.com/oojasic.htm))

I am very fond of teaching, and have taught or otherwise helped people learn to code / get into the software industry - including several batchmates and juniors from Manipal. Earlier this year, I decided to quit my job and start a programming workshop.
