Programming 

Hi! I'm [Divyansh Prakash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyansh-prakash-0385bb93/), a 2014 BE (I&CT) graduate from MIT, Manipal.

I've been working in the software industry for the last 3 years, and have had the good fortune of using various (cutting edge) technologies in the process. Including hobby projects, I've worked on a broad range of software applications, such as:
* distributed systems (http://kokonetworks.com/, https://www.helpshift.com/)
* big data (https://www.helpshift.com/)
* games (http://divs1210.github.io/kilvish/, http://divs1210.github.io/snake-machine/)
* compilers, etc. (https://github.com/divs1210/cljos, https://github.com/divs1210/Impala, http://justaddhotwater.webs.com/oojasic.htm)

I am also fond of teaching, and have taught or otherwise helped people learn to code / get into the software industry - including several batchmates and juniors from Manipal.
